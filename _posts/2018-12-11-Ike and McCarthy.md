Book covers how President Eisenhower carefully waged a political attack on Senator Joseph McCarthy. The thesis is a little strained in that it assumes a deliberate and timely strategy where a more likely interpretation was lack of political will on Eisenhower's part.

Ike and McCarthy: Dwight Eisenhower's Secret Campaign Against Joseph McCarthy

* Eisenhower used his power as President to orchestrate the hearings that brought down McCarthy. He also ensured that he had the legislative push to do so and struck when the time was right. This was an example of Eisenhower's ability to judge a situation, develop a plan, and see it through to completion.
Prologue

* Eisenhower's decision to drop a paragraph in a campaign speech supporting General Marshall often is attributed to Eisenhower cowering before McCarthy but Nichols argues that it was really Eisenhower's naivete about politics that led to his decision.
Part 1

* Eisenhower understood that he wanted to remove McCarthy and undercut his position but he knew that he had to keep his priorities in line. He needed to end the Korean War and ensure that the American people looked to him as their best defender of freedom and their best defense against communism.
* Eisenhower faced problems early on in his administration. His nominee for ambassador to the Soviet Union Bohlens created problems because of Bohlens participation in the Yalta conference. Eisenhower stood up to McCarthy and did not let him stop the nomination. He used his position as President to ensure that the Senate received the information necessary to verify Secretary of State Dulles' testimony.
* When McCarthy said that he negotiated with Greek merchant shippers to have them halt shipping to Communist countries he aggravated his relationship with Eisenhower. Eisenhower quickly moved to to the senator in his place and let him know that Eisenhower was not afraid of him.
* McCarthy began to investigate the Army for communists in August 1953, he interrogated a clerk typist who had worked for a communist affiliated paper. After getting her to half-heartedly admit that she might have unknowingly joined the communist party, McCarthy spoke to reporters and claimed that he had evidence of Army employees with access to sensitive information about troop movements were associated with the communist party.
* In order to help maintain consistent focus, Eisenhower appointed Fred Seaton to be the liaison to Congress and specifically McCarthy. This allowed Eisenhower to have a main point of contact and provide a more disciplined approach to McCarthy now that the senator was investigating the Army.
* Secretary of the Army Stevens wanted to cooperate with McCarthy and cut out Seaton in some cases to do so. Stevens thought that he could find a way to make McCarthy back off. This was not possible and caused Stevens problems.
* As 1953 drew to a close, there were attempts to get McCarthy to behave. Although none of the attempts had explicit sanction from Eisenhower or even documents showing their connection to the administration. Nichols does not draw a direct connection to the administration to these failed peace initiatives.
Part 2 1954: Mobilization

* Eisenhower moved in his State of the Union speech to show his anti-communist bona fides. However, this did not dissuade McCarthy from continuing his investigations on the Army. Schine, an investigative assistant and wealthy hotel heir. His assignment to MP was part of the reason that McCarthy continued to investigate the Army with such vigor. Schine's friends, Roy Cohn, who picked out McCarthy's targets, was very angry at what he thought broken promises that the Army made to treat Schine well.
* When McCarthy subpoenaed loyalty board members it was too much for Eisenhower. He asked his Attorney General to determine if the Executive branch had to allow it. Attorney General Brownell said that he did not think that the Executive branch had to honor them. Also, Brownell chaired a meeting where they realized that the Schine problems could cause the downfall of McCarthy.
* When the Secretary of the Army met with several Republican senators including McCarthy, he thought that they agreed to treat soldiers with respect while they testified. However, the statement that the senators put out did not discuss any of their concessions but only focused on the fact that Stevens agreed that officers should cooperate with the committee. This made Eisenhower furious and, in the press, he came out looking like he capitulated to McCarthy.
* Much of the argument is innuendo and coincidence and not as much based on hard clear documentation. This is not a weakness in the research but more of a reality when dealing with the President who did not want to be clearly in charge.
* Eisenhower coordinated the release of the Schine report so that it was able to to do ultimate damage to McCarthy. It came on the heels of Ed Murrow's television show about McCarthy and came from the Army, not the White House. It was only released to certain legislators in the hope that they would demand that the government release to the press.
Part 3 1954 Vindication

* Eisenhower's administration wanted the Army hearings to be on TV in order for the nation to see how they transpired. Also, the administration did not allow their officials to appear without lawyers. This ensured that they would not get into more trouble by answering questions that they did not need to answer.
* Eisenhower declined McCarthy's attempts to take the hearings off of television. Eisenhower knew that McCarthy did not come off well in the hearings and he did not know McCarthy to have a forum where he could easily misconstrue the true nature of what happened in hearings.
* As the hearing progressed it became clear that the administration had a role in orchestrating the release of the Schine report. However, Eisenhower used Executive Privilege to prevent administration officials from discussing any advice they gave to the President. This allowed Secretary of the Army Stevens to issue a statement denying any involvement of the administration in the decision to create or release the Schine report. This took the heat off of the administration and Eisenhower ensured that the hearings did not end because of it.
* Eisenhower's plan worked and McCarthy's venom, when exposed to the American people, finally collapsed his base of power. Eisenhower continued not to take a public stance against the senator even when McCarthy publicly broke with Eisenhower.
